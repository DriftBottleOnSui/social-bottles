- Has anyone ever told you, "I love you more than anything"?

## Project Overview
This project is a social game based on the Sui blockchain where users can make new friends by throwing and picking up drift bottles and engage in further conversations. The game combines blockchain technology with the traditional drift bottle concept, providing users with a fun and decentralized social experience. You can try it out at https://drift-bottle.walrus.site.

## Features
- **Throw Drift Bottles**: Users can throw message bottles into the sea, supporting both text and images. All messages are stored on Walrus.
- **Pick Drift Bottles**: Users can pick up drift bottles left by others and read the messages inside.
- **Friends System**: Users can make friends by picking up bottles and later engage in further conversations (currently in development).
- **AI Content Compliance Check**: The game integrates AI functionality to check the compliance of content in drift bottles, preventing messages that contain sensitive topics such as politics, adult content, or violence. This ensures a healthy ecosystem within the game.
- **Walrus Integration**: All static resources of the game are stored on Walrus, ensuring efficient resource management and distribution. For more details, refer to the [Walrus Sites Documentation](https://docs.walrus.site/walrus-sites/intro.html).
